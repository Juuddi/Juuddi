**I'm Juuddi**. I have a background in aerospace engineering and blockchain. I'm currently working as a _Lead Engineer_ at [Arctype Ventures](https://arctypeventures.com/).

I enjoy building full-stack applications, user tooling, writing user-friendly documentation, and building blockchain apps. I've built and worked on a number of projects:

**Frontend Interfaces**
- [**quai-no-code-deployer**](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-no-code-deployer): A friendly user interface to easily deploy and interact with NFTs and Tokens on Quai Network built with NextJs.
- [**quai-next-dapp**](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-next-dapp): A boilerplate dapp built on top of Quai Network built with NextJs and Chakra-UI.
- [Quai Network Ecosystem Page](https://ecosystem.quai.network/): A central hub for Quai Network ecosystem projects.
- [Quai Faucet](https://faucet.quai.network): Web based interface for the Quai Network testnet faucet.

**Documentation**
- [**quai-docs**](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-docs): Open-source documentation for the Quai Network protocol.
- [pelagus-docs](https://github.com/PelagusWallet/pelagus-docs): Open-source documentation for the Pelagus Wallet extension.

**Tooling**
- [quais.js](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quais.js): A comprehensive Typescript library built for interacting with Quai Network.
- [hardhat-example](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/hardhat-example): A hardhat project modified to deploy Solidity smart contracts on Quai Network.
- [quai-node-cli-tool](https://github.com/dominant-strategies/quai-node-cli-tool): A bash based GUI used to easily manage your Quai Network node and stratum-proxy.

I also enjoy shooting film photography :) (My fav camera is the Olympus OM-1)
